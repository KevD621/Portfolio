I endure and appreciate the challenges and knowledge that are presented to me during my undergrade studies, courses I study during my free time, and potential intern experiences as I walk my path to become a computer security professional. 

 

Most importantly, I outline my mission as one who can contribute to public and personal safety in the growing digital world. As adversaries posing great danger, there needs to be a guardian who can ensure the safety and security of the people. Fully compiling and agreeing to the ethical policies and principles, I dream of becoming a part of the team of guardians, making myself the strongest weapon the people can use to defend themselves. 

 

With my undergraduate degree, I learned and am learning to think like a coder and solve problems like an engineer, one step at a time. At the same time familiarizing myself with several programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, I still require the experience and knowledge of security tools and skills in the professional field. But I hold faith and trust in myself and my ability to contribute and embrace myself with the passion and goal of a cyber security team.
